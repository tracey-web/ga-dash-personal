PROJECT 1: BUILD A PERSONAL WEBSITE
Your friend Anna wants you to make a website for her
1. Make the headline and inputs
2. Style the background and text
3. Add a background image and logo
4. Build your own personal website

Extensions:
Added the Media Queries to make the site responsive (images and text need to be much smaller).
Added the email form so it the email is actually sent with a comment, first, last and email address.
